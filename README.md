**UrchiNet** is a .NET client for the [Urchin API v1](https://secure.urchin.com/helpwiki/en/Data_API.html).

The API methods are available through the [UrchiNet.Service](https://github.com/mausch/UrchiNet/blob/master/UrchiNet/CSharp.fs) class. 
There's also an AsyncService class providing support for async requests.

You can see some usage examples [here](https://github.com/mausch/UrchiNet/blob/master/UrchiNet.CSharpTests/Tests.cs).
